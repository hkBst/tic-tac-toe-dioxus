# tic-tac-toe-dioxus
This is an extremely minimal [tic-tac-toe](https://github.com/hkBst/tic-tac-toe) webUI using [dioxus](https://github.com/dioxuslabs/dioxus), for comparison with other Rust front-end frameworks.

## how to use
Dioxus does not work with [trunk](https://github.com/thedodd/trunk), but instead uses its own tool, so install that: `cargo install dioxus-cli`.

Use `dx serve` when developing and `dx build --release` when deploying.
